# Flutter Chord Generator

Just a little side project for fun. Write an intention in the main text field, pick a mode (or build your own), and click 'get chords' to generate a set of four chords based on your input. Make sure to elaborate so that the algorithm has enough characters to work with and don't use punctuation. That's it!

Useful for musicians who like a little targeted chaos in their songwriting process.
